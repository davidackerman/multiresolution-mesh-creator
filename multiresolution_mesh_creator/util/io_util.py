    Context manager.
    
    Redirects a file object or file descriptor to a new file descriptor.

        with stdout_redirected(f):
            print('Writing to my-stdout.txt')
    
    Motivation: In pure-Python, you can redirect all print() statements like this:
        
        sys.stdout = open('myfile.txt')
        
        ...but that doesn't redirect any compiled printf() (or std::cout) output
        from C/C++ extension modules.
    This context manager uses a superior approach, based on low-level Unix file
    descriptors, which redirects both Python AND C/C++ output.
